# Text-Classification-using-NLP
## Project Title
Adding Intelligence to our CRM and improving conversion ratio using Artificial Intelligence
## Project Description
Understanding customer patterns is one of the important activities in
every business, based on customer pattern and customer status our next step was majorly
planned in every business process.
Task-1:Based on customer status identify the topic whether the customer showing interest
or not towards our product
Task-2:Based on location, status and type of business executive identify whether the lead
going to be converted on not.
## Data Description
Customer Name, Location of the customer, Status whether lead converted or not converted
and description with business executive name which explain about basic conversation
between client and business executive.
## Approach
1.Understanding the business problem.
2.Designing the approach and collection of data.
3.Preprocessing the data and applying the machine learning algorithm.
4.Plotting the result and classification matrix.
## Challenges
1.Choosing the right algorithm.
2.Handling the imbalanced dataset.
3.The classification rate were quite low for the converted customer as there was very low amount of records as compared to non converted customer.
4.To overcome the above challenege we used data augumentation technique.We used Contextual Word embedding based upon the bert based uncased model which incerased classification rate from 1% to 75% and accuracy score from 81% to 95%.
## Result and Conclusion
We were able to deliever the real time solution for the given problem also able to increase the conversion ratio from 10% to 55% signinficantly which added increase in the ROI of the company.
